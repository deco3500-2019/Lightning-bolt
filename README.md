1. 15% of Australians are expected to experience depression at some point in their life. 
2. In 2017, suicide counted for a third of all teenage deaths.
3. 72% of Australians use social media regularly, and it has potential for aggravating mental illness.
4. Most social media use is through smartphones.

With these facts in mind, we decided to create a responsive web app for self-managing mental health for our DECO3500 project. <br>
It includes features such as:
* Journal article writing
* Daily mood tracking
* Social media reflection
* Referral to mental health services

The project has a wiki, containing the documentation and other paperwork for the project:
* [Overview](https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Lightning-bolt/wiki/Home)
* [Team Charter](https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Lightning-bolt/wiki/Team-charter)
* [Project Proposal](https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Lightning-bolt/wiki/Proposal)
* [Promotional Materials](https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Lightning-bolt/wiki/Promotional-material)

## Technologies
* HTML/CSS/JS
* Bootstrap
* MySQL/PHP

## Installation
This was designed to be deployed onto a ready-made UQ Zone, which automatically handled the web server (presumably Apache) and MyPHP database.
1. Install whatever LAMP stack you are most comfortable with.
3. Clone this repo to wherever you expect to need it.
4. Point the web server to `index.html`.

## Usage
Specific details on using the app are can be found on the wiki: https://github.com/deco3500-2019/Lightning-bolt/wiki/Prototype-3

## Status
This project is complete and will not be developed further.
